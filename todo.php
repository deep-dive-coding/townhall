LATER:

Search engine optimization

Notify by email if password is changed and allow user to deny change if unrecognized
Basic password rules (block common passwords, min length, etc)
Send user email when password is changed
Issue new session when address is changed -> otherwise they still only have access to their old district and not new
Only allow user to change address once per day so they can just keep changing address to troll other districts
