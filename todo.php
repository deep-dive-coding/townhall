TODO:



NOW:

Forgot password / password reset

Redirect after authorization token activation broken

Figure out how to avoid getting mail@abqtownhall from getting marked as spam

Prioritize posts by vote (need to determine method to sort)

Wire up contact form

Change state from a text field to a drop down so that only state-abbreviations can be entered (in sign-up and edit profile)

Show number of replies to parentPosts in parent header

Add indicators for officials accounts




LATER:

Check error messages for end-user-ability

Search engine optimization

Get-text for language translation

Notify by email if password is changed an allow user to deny change if unrecognized

Minimal password rules (block common passwords, min length, etc)

Send user email when password is changed

Issue new session when address is changed -> otherwise they still only have access to their old district and not new

Only allow user to change address once per day so they can just keep changing address to troll other districts
