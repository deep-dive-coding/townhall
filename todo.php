/**
TODO:



NOW:

Add indicators for officials accounts

Prioritize posts by vote (need to determine method to sort)

Wire up contact form

Change state from a text field to a drop down so that only state-abbreviations can be entered (in sign-up and edit profile)

Check error messages for end-user-ability

Search engine optimization

Redirect after authorization token activation broken

Edit profile broken -> can't leave 2nd address field blank if something was there previously, also does not recheck district after changing address

Figure out how to avoid getting mail@abqtownhall from getting marked as spam



LATER:

Reset textbox after post success

Show number of replies to parents in header

Get-text for language translation

Notify by email if password is changed an allow user to deny change if unrecognized

Forgot password / password reset

Password rules (block common passwords, min length, etc) but no security theater bullshit
